# MVP Frontend - Virtual Wine Cellar

This project encompasses the requirements for the delivery of the MVP for **Sprint I: Basic Full Stack Development of the Software Engineering** postgraduate course at PUC RIO.

The objective is to use the content taught during the classes to create a single-page application, including both frontend and backend. A virtual wine cellar was designed to achieve this, where wines can be added, viewed, or deleted.

More specifically, the **frontend of the MVP** will be explored in the code provided here.
